# Question Queue

**Question Queue** is an app that allows teachers and students to easily navigate the Q&A process for lessons and TownHall meetings. Due to its in-built code editor, it is geared towards technical questions. It also allows the user to rapidly share snippets of code to the group.

Authentication works with GitHub, but all users must be approved by an admin before having access to the app.

Built using React, Node and MongoDB.

**To log in to a sample student profile use the following credentials:**

**user:** student-guest
**password:** student-guest-1

There are two types of user roles in Question Queue: **students** and **admins**.

Students can browse the list of questions and answers from their respective group. They can also easily ask questions and attach tags and code snippets to them.

There is an upvote system in place that allows the students (and teachers) to upvote the best questions for everyone to see.

Users can also go to their profile page and see all the questions they have ever asked on one screen.

Admins can add and remove students from the app. They can manage groups of students across different cities and most importantly answer questions via code snippets.
